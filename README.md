### Recent Projects

* ***[Lenguau](https://kafkaesc.github.io/Lenguau/)*** üßø Leng-wow! I built this project to help myself and a few friends practice English-Spanish vocabulary. Pick a game and a category and go off! The entire site and its README files are all bilingual. 
* ***[Call-Me-Ishmael](https://kafkaesc.github.io/Call-Me-Ishmael/)*** üêã The hyphens are part of the name. This project has a chat window where you can send a text ("Call me, Ishmael") using HTML elements with various Angular event handlers. Learn how different HTML elements will behave, and how to avoid unexpected behavior for keyboard-focused or keyboard-dependent users.
