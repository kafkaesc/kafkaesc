### Recent Projects

* ***[Lenguau](https://kafkaesc.github.io/Lenguau/)***. Leng-wow! I built this project to help myself and a few friends practice English-Spanish vocabulary. The site has two different games with five different vocabulary categories. The entire site and its README files are all bilingual in the spirit of practicing my Spanish translation skills. 
* ***[Call-Me-Ishmael](https://kafkaesc.github.io/Call-Me-Ishmael/)***. The hyphens are part of the name. This project has a chat window where you can send a text ("Call me, Ishmael") using different HTML elements with different combinations of onClick and keyup.enter Angular event handlers. The purpose is to demonstrate how different HTML elements will behave, and how to avoid unexpected behavior for keyboard-focused or keyboard-dependent users.

### Start a conversation

* ***Talk about a project***. Do you have an idea for a project you want to rubber duck with someone? Are you interested in how I implemented one of my projects? Lets talk about it.
* ***Tell me about your favorite writer***. I didn't just study computer science in college, I studied English too! Tell me about your favorite writer, book, or short story. I'd love to hear.
